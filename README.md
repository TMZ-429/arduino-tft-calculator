# INSTALLATION
First, you're going to need to add the CLExpr library to your Arduino libs.

This can be done by making a directory called CLExpr in your Arduino libraries directory & installing CLExpr in it

This should be possible by issuing the following commands:
```
$ mkdir ~/Arduino/libraries/CLExpr
$ mv CLExpr.cpp ~/Arduino/libraries/CLExpr/CLExpr.cpp
$ mv CLExpr.h ~/Arduino/libraries/CLExpr/CLExpr.h
```


Afterwards, you should be able to compile the program normally
