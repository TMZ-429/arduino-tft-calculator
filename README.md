# INSTALLATION
First, you're going to need to add the CLExpr library to your Arduino libs.

This can be done by making a directory called CLExpr in your Arduino libraries directory

This should be possible by issuing the following command:
```
$ mkdir ~/Arduino/libraries/CLExpr.h
```


Afterwards, you should be able to compile the program normally
